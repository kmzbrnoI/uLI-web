We use uLI in the [Model Railroader Club in Brno](https://kmz-brno.cz/) quite
heavily. We use it for both normal track and programming. uLI connects main
command station of our railway with main software controlling the whole
traffic. We used uLI at several public exhibitions lasting at least for 3 weeks
and there were no problems with it.
